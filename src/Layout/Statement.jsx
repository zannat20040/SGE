              The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a crucial document for students
              who want to study abroad. It is typically 1000â€“1200 words long and
              serves as an essay that showcases your identity and outlines the
              value you will bring to the university. It is important to follow
              a specific format and stick to the word limit to create an
              impressive SOP. If you need detailed guidance on how to structure
              a compelling Statement of Purpose, you can seek assistance from
              Shabuj Global Educations's counselors.

            <h1>A typical SOP generally follows the following structure:</h1>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-8 ">
              {statementOfPurposeComponents.map((item, index) => (
                <li className="" key={index}>
                  {item}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Statement;
